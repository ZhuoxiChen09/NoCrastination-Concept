# NoCrastination — Cognitive-Science-Based Productivity System (Concept Design)

This repository showcases the **concept design**, early UI structure, and system thinking behind *NoCrastination* —  
a productivity assistant inspired by **cognitive science**, **behavioral psychology**, and **human-centered design**.

The goal of NoCrastination is to reduce decision fatigue, support focused work, and help users build sustainable productivity habits through intelligent task planning and distraction control.

---

## Overview

NoCrastination is built on the principle that productivity is shaped by **how the mind manages attention, memory load, and motivation**, not just task scheduling.

This repository documents early conceptual work, including:
- System architecture and design principles
- User interface screens and flows
- Cognitive science principles integrated into the design
- Visual identity and product direction

This is a **concept repository**, not a production application.

## Cognitive Principles Behind the Concept
The design integrates several research-backed principles:

- **Cognitive Offloading** — reducing working-memory strain through external systems  
- **Attention Guidance** — surfacing key tasks at the right time  
- **Task Chunking** — breaking complex tasks into smaller actionable steps  
- **Temporal Motivation Theory** — supporting motivation for long-term goals  
- **Low-Friction UX** — simple flows to reduce decision barriers
